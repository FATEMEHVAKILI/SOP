<h1>Statement of Purpose for Ph.D.</h1>
In today's world, the advancement of artificial intelligence and information technology is inevitable. Therefore, I decided to express my interests and desires. I am Fatemeh Vakili, born in February 1998. I am a 4th-semester student of Information Technology Engineering at Tarbiat Modares University. 
  <br>
Artificial intelligence and information technology fascinated me since high school. I was amazed by the way everything happened with artificial intelligence in the world. These events encouraged me to reach my goal. The increasing importance of artificial intelligence will play a central role in the coming years. I would like to be among the top professors in the field of artificial intelligence in the world. I am confident that I will achieve this goal with further study and research. Therefore, studying at the doctoral level will be of great help in advancing the goals. It's something that excites me and I look forward to it.
  <br>
 
Throughout my undergraduate studies, I believed that I could study at Iran's first-level universities, and this goal came true in my master's degree. I am confident that this goal will also happen in the doctoral degree. I have always had the desire to explore real-world applications of AI. Therefore, during my bachelor's days, I tried my best to be a successful person in my field. My bachelor's period lasted from September 23, 2018, to July 2, 2021, that is, for 6 semesters. Some of the work experiences and projects in the undergraduate degree include:
  <br>
1. Cloud Computing architecture
  <br>
2. Review of Satellite Internet
  <br>
3. Designing a website with SEO 
  <br>
4. Electronic circuit design with Proteus
  <br>
5. Virtualization
  <br>
6. Training Git
  <br>
Since I was very interested in participating in scientific and cultural activities, I have worked as the secretary of the Computer Engineering Scientific Association and the main member of the association for two years. During this period, we implemented programming courses at the university. Tutoring groups were established to support and help students.
  <br>
    
In my opinion, people should always be their best selves. So I tried to study and learn more in the field of programming and artificial intelligence.
Immediately after completing my bachelor's degree, I studied at the master's level. The most beautiful part of this study is that I reached my goal of being admitted to one of Iran's first-level universities (Tarbiat Modares University). This was very encouraging to me. This success will be further motivation to continue studying at the doctoral level. Master's studies started on September 23, 2021, and will continue until September 22, 2023. Also, I was among the top ranks in the entrance examination. The closer I got to my goals, the more effort I put in. During my master's degree, I implemented 2 startups:
  <br> 
  1. Implementation of the virtual fitting room website for the women of our beloved country
  <br> 
  2. Implementation of the automatic security assessment system. 
  <br> 
  These two startups met with relative success in 2022. In the next research, the design of a system titled "Student" was to help new master's students, which was implemented in 2022. Future projects include a music recommender system with unsupervised networks in 2022, a prediction of a heart attack in 2022, and color image segmentation with fuzzy. After doing these projects, I became much more interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and image analysis. So, I decided to do more scientific work and publish their articles.
  <br>
My thesis is also in the field of machine learning and medical image analysis. The case study is the MS patients of Imam Hossein Hospital in Tehran. I received the clinical data of the patients over two years. These data are disease onset. Brain and spinal cord images of the patients are also examined for two years and the volume of brain lesions is measured. Finally, based on the clinical data and medical images of the patients, the probability of recurrence of the disease in the next year is predicted.
  <br>
My mother was the reason for choosing this disease. My mother has MS. It is very valuable for me to do scientific work to help these patients. Therefore, with all the difficulties in this field, I am very pleased that I chose it. This motivation and my interest in this field made me able to the top educational and research rank at Tarbiat Modares University. This is a great honor for me. I am trying to be able to do valuable scientific work for my doctoral degree. Also, I will get the highest educational and research rank in the doctoral degree.
  <br>
Two of my articles titled Drug Recommender System Based on Collaborative Filtering for Multiple Sclerosis Patients and Supervised Machine Learning Models for Multiple Sclerosis Relapse Probability Prognosis using Clinical Data have been accepted in the field of machine learning. I plan to have my next article accepted by the end of September.
  <br>
One of my other interests was playing the piano, which I went to its training classes, and I did bodybuilding professionally.
  <br>
I hope that with the help and support of respected professors, I can apply artificial intelligence in larger projects that will contribute to a leading future in the field of treatment and disease control. Therefore, admission to top universities will be effective in achieving the goals of my interests. Another reason for continuing my doctoral studies is to teach students at top universities. I hope I can succeed in this goal and train students with high academic literacy and hard work. I believe I have fully expressed my passion for this field. Certainly, admission to the doctoral program will bring me to all my goals.
